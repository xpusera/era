Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions
that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of
authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights
specified in the public license below.

Section 1 – Definitions.

1. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
   that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
   Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
   modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights
   held by the Licensor.

2. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar
   Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material.

3. BY‑SA Compatible License means a license listed at
   https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses.

4. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
   related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,
   sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights.

5. Effective Technological Measures means measures that restrict acts not
   authorized by the Licensor or permitted by law.

6. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
   exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights.

7. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
   material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

8. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
   conditions of this Public License.

9. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this
   Public License.

10. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process
    requiring permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
    display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
    importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways
    that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
    individually chosen by them.

11. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from
    Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996,
    as amended or replaced — or other equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

12. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
    this Public License.

Section 2 – Scope.

2.1 License grant.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby
grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

   a) reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and  
   b) produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

2.2 Exceptions and Limitations.  
For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use,
this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms
and conditions.

2.3 Term.  
The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

2.4 Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.  
The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications
necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right
or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to
exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to
circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces
Adapted Material.

2.5 Downstream recipients.

   a) Offer from the Licensor — Licensed Material.  
   Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from
   the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions
   of this Public License.

   b) Additional offer from the Licensor — Adapted Material.  
   Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer
   from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
   under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.

   c) No downstream restrictions.  
   You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions
   on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material
   if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the
   Licensed Material.

   d) No endorsement.  
   Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission
   to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is,
   connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by the
   Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section
   3(a)(1)(A)(i).

2.6 Other rights.  
Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public
License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights;
however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert
any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You
to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. Patent and trademark rights
are not licensed under this Public License. To the extent possible, the Licensor
waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
Rights,
whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable
statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor
expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

3. a. Attribution.  
   i. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
      A. retain the copyright notice(s) for the Licensed Material;

         supplied;  
      C. provide a copyright notice (if supplied);  
      D. provide a license notice, a legal notice, a disclaimer notice (if

      F. provide a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material if supplied; and  
      G. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and include a URI or
         hyperlink to the modified material if reasonably practicable.

       identify that You changed the Licensed Material, and include a URI or
       hyperlink to the Licensed Material if reasonably practicable.

3. b. ShareAlike.  
   If You Share Adapted Material, You must distribute your contributions under
   the same license as the original (this Public License).  

3. c. No additional restrictions.  
   You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict
   others from doing anything the license permits.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.  
Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your
use of the Licensed Material:

   a) for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,
      reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents
      of the database;  
   b) if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
      database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database
      in which You have those rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted
      Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and  
   c) You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
      substantial portion of the contents of the database.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

The Licensed Material is provided “as‑is.” To the greatest extent permitted by
applicable law:

   a) The licensor offers no warranties of any kind.  
   b) In no event shall the licensor be liable to You for any damages arising
      from the use of or inability to use the Licensed Material.  

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

   a) The Public License applies for the duration of the rights licensed.  
   b) You automatically lose the Licensed Rights if You fail to comply with this
      Public License.  
   c) However, Your rights automatically reinstate if You cure the violation within
      30 days of discovering it or the licensor explicitly reinstates the rights.  
   d) The Licensor may stop distributing the Licensed Material or offer it under
      different terms — but this does not terminate the license for existing recipients.  
   e) Sections 1, 5, 6, 7 and 8 survive any termination.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

   1. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
      conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.  
   2. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material
      not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and
      conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

   a) This Public License does not reduce, limit, restrict or impose conditions
      on uses of the Licensed Material that are allowed without permission under
      law.  
   b) If any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it will
      be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it
      enforceable. If it cannot be reformed, it will be severed but the rest of
      the license remains in effect.  
   c) No waiver or consent applies unless expressly agreed.  
   d) Nothing in this Public License constitutes a waiver of privileges or
      immunities that may apply to the Licensor or You under applicable law.
